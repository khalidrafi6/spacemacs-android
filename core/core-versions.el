;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file defines the current Spacemacs version and the minimum supported
;; Emacs version. It also provides a macro for conditional evaluation based on
;; the minimum Emacs version required by Spacemacs.

;;; Code:

;;;; Version Constants

;; The current version of Spacemacs.
;; This string should be updated whenever a new release is made.
(defconst spacemacs-version
  "0.999.0"
  "Spacemacs version. This string identifies the current release of Spacemacs.")

;; The minimum version of Emacs required to run Spacemacs.
;; If a user attempts to run Spacemacs on an older version, it may not work
;; correctly or may refuse to start.
(defconst spacemacs-emacs-min-version
  "28.2"
  "Minimal version of Emacs required by Spacemacs. Older versions are unsupported.")

;;;; Conditional Evaluation Macro

;; This macro allows you to conditionally execute code depending on the minimum
;; Emacs version required by Spacemacs. It is useful for writing code that should
;; only run if Spacemacs is configured to require an older Emacs version.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (spacemacs|eval-until-emacs-min-version "29.1"
;;     (message "This code runs only if the minimum Emacs version is less than 29.1"))
;;
;; Arguments:
;;   VERSION - A string representing the Emacs version to compare against.
;;   BODY    - One or more forms to evaluate if the condition is met.
(defmacro spacemacs|eval-until-emacs-min-version (version &rest body)
  "Evaluate BODY if `spacemacs-emacs-min-version' < VERSION.

VERSION is a string representing the Emacs version to compare.
BODY is one or more forms to execute if the minimum version is less than VERSION.

This macro is useful for maintaining compatibility code that should only run
when supporting older Emacs versions."
  (declare (indent 1))
  `(when (version< spacemacs-emacs-min-version ,version)
     (progn ,@body)))

;;;; Provide Feature

;; Make this feature available for require statements in other files.
